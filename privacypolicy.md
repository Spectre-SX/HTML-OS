# Privacy Policy
**Last updated: June 28, 2025**

Your privacy is super important to us. Here’s how we handle your data:

**What We Collect**
We temporarily collect your location data only to get weather info from a public API.

**How We Use It**
Your location is used solely to fetch and display weather updates. We do not store or share this info with anyone else.

**Data Security**
We use standard security measures to protect your data while it’s in use. Since we don’t store your location, risk is minimized.

**Third-Party APIs**
We use public weather APIs to get weather data. They may have their own privacy policies—check them if you’re curious.

**Your Rights**
You can stop sharing your location anytime by turning off location permissions in your device settings.

**Changes to This Policy**
If we update this policy, we’ll let you know through the app.
